For lab 2, the topic that interested me the most, and the one that I did my search on was Climate Change. For the search, the research was conducted for the date of January 17, 2023, with a radius of 15.8 miles. The locations that the data was collected for was for Seattle, Washington(Figure 1), Tacoma, Washington(Figure 2), and Los Angeles, California (Figure 3). I chose to collect data of [Seattle, Washington] because the location is known to have a lot of environmental activists, always having awareness for the environment and climate change. One example is the Climate Pledge arena, the arena that is used to play basketball. The second location that I chose was [Tacoma, Washington]. The reason for this is because it is my hometown, making me want to learn more about climate change activities around the area. Another reason is because I wanted to compare if there are any differences in the tweets being made between Seattle and Tacoma, despite them being fairly close to each other. The last location that I chose was [Los Angeles, California]. This is because for the last location, I would like to look at a populated location, and one that is farther away from the other two location. With this, I am able to check whether distances, and different states change people's perception and how they tweet about climate change. 

With the data collected from the three locations, I was able to create three seperate word clouds. I found that the similarties between the three is that since it is about climate change, there were a lot of tweets that mentioned climate change. Another similarity is that global is mentioned a lot. I believe that the reason for this is because climate change is a global issue, meaning that it takes a lot of individuals to cause the issue and spread it, being cause from individuals all around the world. This also means the the other way as well, that climate change will effect individuals all around the world. 

The difference that I notice between the state of Washington(Figure 4 & 5) and California(Figure 6) was that in California, there is emphasis on mentions of the environment, involving food, farms, and energy. However, in Washington there is more emphasis on the people and capitalism, for instance businesses, work, and money. I believe the reason for this is because since California is a place with more heat, there is a lot more aggriculture, and having a consistent climate allows them to grow crops easily. However, in Washington, it is more of a cold area, not having a lot of crops. While also in Washington, specifically the locations I chose, are in Seattle or close to there, where the technology companies are all located. 

After doing this research, I believe that to improve it, I should have searched more locations, whether it be different states, or compare two different locations in California vs two different locations in Washington. I believe that the most optimal method, however, is to do research on most populated cities in each states, seeing if there are differences and similarities.

From looking at the map to comparing the data of the tweets, I noticed that there were nothing that different from my expectations. The only differences is that although I chose to do my tweet in Los Angeles, the more mentioned tweets weren't about corporation or business, it was more about the environment like energy, farms, and aggriculture. For Seattle, I did not expect there to be a lot of emphasis on capitalism because there are a lot of awarenesses surrounding climate change, like the climate pledge arena.
